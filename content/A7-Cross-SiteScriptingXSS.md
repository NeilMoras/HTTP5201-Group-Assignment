title: A7-Cross Site Scripting XSS
date: 1624042000000
description: XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

## Summary

There are mainly 3 types of XSS that is used by attackers.
- <strong>Reflected XSS</strong>: Reflected attacks only require that the malicious script to be embedded into a link. The script is embedded into a link, and is executed everytime the same is clicked. This can avoided by vigilant users.
- <strong>Stored XSS</strong>: Stored XSS follows the attack method like Reflected, but the difference is that the attacker finds a website that has injection vulnerability. Attacker embeds his external code into the page and everytime a user accesses the page, the script will execute. This is because the external script is now part of the vulnerable website, and is rendered on the user's browser.
- <strong>DOM XSS</strong>: DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities usually arise when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controllable source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as eval() or innerHTML.
